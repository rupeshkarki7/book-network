Creating a security policy for your GitHub repository, especially for a full-stack web application like "book-network" which uses technologies such as Spring, JWT, JSP, Docker, Angular, etc., is essential for ensuring that contributors and users understand the security measures and protocols in place. Below is an example of a comprehensive security policy:

## Security Policy

### Overview

Welcome to the **book-network** repository. This document outlines the security policies and procedures for reporting vulnerabilities and protecting the integrity of our full-stack web application. Our tech stack includes Spring, JWT, JSP, Docker, Angular, and other related technologies.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose it to us. Please follow the steps below:

1. **Do not open a public issue:** To protect users, do not file public issues for vulnerabilities.
2. **Contact Us:** Send an email to [security@book-network.com](mailto:security@book-network.com) with the details of the vulnerability.
   - **Include:** 
     - A description of the vulnerability.
     - Steps to reproduce the issue.
     - Potential impact.
     - Any relevant logs or screenshots.
3. **Response Time:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for fixing the vulnerability.

### Supported Versions

We aim to support the latest stable release and the previous minor release of our application. Security updates will be applied to these versions.

### Security Measures

To maintain the security of our application, we have implemented the following measures:

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Using Spring Security with JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Data Validation:** Input validation on both client-side (Angular) and server-side (Spring) to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common attacks.
- **HTTPS:** Enforcing HTTPS to secure data transmission.
- **Dependencies:** Regularly updating dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- **Docker Security:** Utilizing best practices for securing Docker containers, such as running containers with non-root users and minimizing the attack surface.
- **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews for all changes, focusing on security implications.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Integrating security checks in our CI/CD pipelines to catch vulnerabilities early.

### Development Best Practices

We follow industry best practices for secure development, including:

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Granting only the necessary permissions to users and services.
- **Error Handling:** Avoiding detailed error messages that can disclose system information.
- **Session Management:** Implementing secure session handling to prevent session fixation and hijacking.
- **Environment Configuration:** Storing sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in environment variables, not in source code.

### Community Guidelines

We encourage the community to contribute to the security of the **book-network** application by:

- **Reporting Vulnerabilities:** Following the reporting guidelines mentioned above.
- **Contributing Code:** Submitting pull requests with security improvements or fixes.
- **Staying Informed:** Keeping up-to-date with the latest security practices and news relevant to our tech stack.
